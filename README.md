# MicroArrayExpress
This repo encapsulates a thorough microarray analysis exploring differential gene expression in plants exposed to alternating light and darkness. Subsequent KEGG pathway analysis unveils specific pathways undergoing significant modifications, offering nuanced insights into the regulatory networks orchestrating the plant's adaptive mechanisms.

Following statistical analysis, 587 genes exhibited altered expression levels, with 261 genes displaying upregulation and 361 genes undergoing downregulation.
